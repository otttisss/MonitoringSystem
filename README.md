# Monitoring System

Implementation of the monitoring system project.

## Introduction

In this project, I need to implement a program for simple monitoring of the main indicators of the system as kernels and agents. Agents will need to collect metrics and pass them to the kernel, which will log these metrics. When critical values are reached, the system must send notifications to the user.
