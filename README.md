# Monitoring System

Implementation of the monitoring system project.

## Introduction

In this project, I need to implement a program for simple monitoring of the main indicators of the system as kernels and agents. Agents will need to collect metrics and pass them to the kernel, which will log these metrics. When critical values are reached, the system must send notifications to the user.

## Development features

- The program must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard.
- The program must have a GUI implementation. I chose Qt to implement part of the GUI project.
- The project should be built using a Makefile.
- When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style.
- We need to develop a telegram bot to receive notifications from our Monitoring System program.
